# HbxFinder

HbxFinder is a pipeline for identification and characterisation of homeobox genes in unannotated genomes. Using raw data from [HomeoDB](http://homeodb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) by [Zhong & Holland 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1525-142X.2011.00513.x), this tool uses BLAST based similarity searches to annotate gene families containing homeodomains. Currently, this tool is directed towards use on high quality arthropod genomes.
